= Reusable Workflows
:toc:

== Overview

Centralized GitHub Actions workflows for all cuioss repositories.

Eliminates copy-paste duplication and centralizes action version management.

== Workflow Triggers and Duplicate Prevention

All cuioss caller workflows use a consistent trigger pattern:

[source,yaml]
----
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, "feature/*", "fix/*", "dependabot/**"]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.event.pull_request.base.repo.full_name
    uses: cuioss/cuioss-organization/.github/workflows/reusable-maven-build.yml@...
----

=== Why This Pattern?

* **`push` to `main`, `feature/*`, `fix/*`, and `dependabot/**`**: Ensures all commits are verified, including early pushes to feature/fix branches and dependabot updates before a PR is opened.
* **`pull_request` to `main`**: Verifies all pull requests targeting the main branch, especially important for fork PRs.

=== Avoiding Duplicate Runs

When you push to a feature branch that has an open PR, both triggers fire simultaneously:

1. `push` trigger: "A push to `feature/*` occurred"
2. `pull_request` trigger: "The PR was updated"

The `if` condition on the job prevents duplicate runs by checking the event type and repository:

[source,yaml]
----
if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.event.pull_request.base.repo.full_name
----

This means:

* **Push events**: Always run (handles internal branch pushes)
* **Pull request events**: Only run if from a **fork** (external contributors)

For internal branches, the push event already verifies the code, so we skip the redundant PR event.
For fork PRs, the push event cannot trigger (forks can't trigger push events on the base repo), so we run the PR event.

NOTE: We intentionally do not use workflow-level `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress` because GitHub has a https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/8336[known bug] where cancelled workflows appear as "failed" in PR checks, blocking merges.

== Available Workflows

[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
|Workflow |Purpose |Typical Lines Saved

|`reusable-maven-build.yml`
|Main build, Sonar analysis, snapshot deploy
|~100 → ~15

|`reusable-maven-release.yml`
|Release to Maven Central with GPG signing
|~100 → ~15

|`reusable-scorecards.yml`
|OpenSSF Scorecard supply-chain security
|~80 → ~12

|`reusable-dependency-review.yml`
|Dependency vulnerability scanning on PRs
|~30 → ~10

|`reusable-pyprojectx-verify.yml`

== Configuration via project.yml

Consumer repositories can define build and release settings in `.github/project.yml` instead of passing explicit workflow inputs.

=== Example project.yml

[source,yaml]
----
name: my-project
description: My Java project

release:
  current-version: 1.0.0
  next-version: 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT

maven-build:
  java-versions: '["21","25"]'
  java-version: '21'

sonar:
  project-key: cuioss_my-project

pages:
  reference: my-project
----

For full schema documentation, see link:project-yml-schema.adoc[project-yml-schema.adoc].

== Migration Guide

=== Step 1: Replace workflow file

Replace your repo's `~100 line` workflow with `~15 line` caller.

=== Step 2: Verify triggers

Ensure `on:` triggers match your repo's needs.

=== Step 3: Test

Run workflow manually via `workflow_dispatch` to verify.

== Action Version Management

All action versions are pinned centrally in this repo:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Action |Version

|`actions/checkout`
|v6.0.2

|`actions/setup-java`
|v5.2.0

|`step-security/harden-runner`
|v2.14.1

|`actions/cache`
|v5.0.3

|`actions/dependency-review-action`
|v4.8.2

|`github/codeql-action`
|v3.32.0

|`actions/github-script`
|v8

|v7.2.1

|`softprops/action-gh-release`
|v2.5.0
|===

To update versions: Edit the reusable workflows here, all repos inherit automatically.

Dependabot is configured to automatically create PRs for action updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
